# CRCore
A core utilities library for Apple platforms.

## Supported Platforms:
  * iOS v12.0+
  * macOS v10.13+
  * watchOS v4.0+
  * tvOS v12.0+
  * xrOS v1.0+

## Documentation
Documentation is built directly into the source code. It can be compiled in Xcode 15.0+ using
Docc. Versions of Docc prior to the one shipped with Xcode 15 will fail to fully compile the 
documentation, as much of this library is comprised of extensions to other native Apple frameworks.
